        <h2>The Service I can provide</h2>

                <h4>Commitment to Teamwork and Collaboration</h4>
                <p>Throughout my academic and extracurricular experiences, I have actively contributed to team
                    projects, demonstrating strong collaboration and service-oriented values. Whether working on
                    software development projects or any projects given to us, I take pride in supporting my team
                    by fostering open communication, sharing knowledge, and ensuring every member's contributions
                    are valued. By stepping into roles such as a project lead or team coordinator, I have honed my
                    ability to balance responsibilities and help my peers achieve shared goals efficiently.</p>

                <h4>Community Contributions Through Technology</h4>
                <p>Beyond university, I have sought opportunities to give back by leveraging my technical skills for
                    meaningful causes. This includes contributing to open-source projects, volunteering for
                    community tech events, or assisting nonprofits in building basic software tools. I enjoy using
                    my abilities to create solutions that benefit others, whether it's by designing a user-friendly
                    website or helping a local organization streamline their operations. These experiences have
                    deepened my understanding of how technology can drive positive change and strengthened my
                    resolve to make a difference through my work.</p>

                <h4>Software Development and Programming</h4>
                <p>I can contribute to developing high-quality software solutions, including web or mobile
                    applications, using technologies like Java, Python, React, or Node.js. Whether building new
                    features, improving existing functionality, or troubleshooting and fixing bugs, I bring strong
                    coding skills and a passion for clean, efficient code. I can assist in both frontend and backend
                    development, ensuring smooth integration and high-performing systems.
